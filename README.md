Efficient Banking System Management with Hash Tables: A Comprehensive Report

Introduction:
In this data structures assignment, the objective is to assume the role of a database manager overseeing a country's intricate banking system.
The task involves creating a highly efficient and reliable hashmap to store essential bank account information using a combination of IFSC code and account number as unique identifiers. 
The hashmap serves as a fundamental pillar of the banking infrastructure, allowing for streamlined and secure operations, such as accessing account balances, updating financial information, and validating account existence.

Objective and Importance:
The primary objective is to implement and compare four collision resolution strategies within the hashmap structure. 
These strategies include Chaining, Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, and Cubic Probing. The importance of efficient hashing and collision resolution becomes apparent in managing millions of bank accounts nationwide. 
The goal is to ensure accurate data storage, retrievability, and security while mitigating potential chaos caused by hash function collisions.

Implementation Details:
The project provides a basic skeleton code with the BankData class and an Account struct, outlining the methods to be implemented. 
The key functions include creating an account, retrieving top balances, getting account balances, adding transactions, checking account existence, determining database size, computing hash values, and deleting accounts. 
Each of these functions contributes to the overall functionality and reliability of the banking system.

Chaining Strategy:
The Chaining strategy is implemented by creating linked lists at each hash table index to manage collisions.
This approach ensures that accounts sharing the same hash code are organized into linked lists, maintaining accessibility and order. 
The Chaining strategy is particularly effective in handling a large number of collisions, providing a scalable solution for the banking system.

Linear Probing Strategy:
Linear Probing is the next collision resolution tool, navigating hash table slots linearly to find the next available space when a collision occurs. 
This strategy prioritizes proximity, aiming to minimize gaps in the hashmap. 
Linear Probing is efficient in scenarios where contiguous memory allocation is crucial for performance, providing an alternative to Chaining.

Quadratic Probing Strategy:
Quadratic Probing introduces a more sophisticated approach by using quadratic increments to find the next available slot.
This technique strikes a balance between proximity and distribution, mitigating clustering issues associated with linear probing. 
Quadratic Probing provides an additional layer of flexibility in handling collisions.

Cubic Probing Strategy:

Taking the concept further, Cubic Probing employs cubic increments to search for open slots, adding complexity to the probe sequence. 
This strategy aims to distribute data evenly and mitigate clustering issues, offering an alternative approach to both linear and quadratic probing. 
Cubic Probing provides additional flexibility in adapting to diverse hash code distributions.

Performance Evaluation:
The effectiveness of each collision resolution strategy is evaluated based on factors such as speed, memory usage, and scalability. 
In conclusion, this assignment provides a comprehensive exploration of implementing and comparing four collision resolution strategies within a hashmap structure for managing a vast array of bank accounts. 
The Chaining, Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, and Cubic Probing strategies each offer unique advantages and considerations. 
Through this assignment, we gain insights into the real-world applications of data structures in efficiently managing complex systems, such as a country's banking infrastructure. 
The implementation and evaluation of these strategies contribute to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs involved in designing robust and scalable hash table solutions for large-scale databases.
